- **Dependencies Installed**: All Node.js packages installed and working correctly (558 packages)
- **Server Running**: Node.js/Express server with WebSocket support running on 0.0.0.0:5000
- **Frontend Verified**: Professional CAD interface with glassmorphism design fully accessible
- **Deployment Configured**: Production deployment set up with autoscale for optimal performance
- **Workflow Active**: Development server running with nodemon for hot reloading
- **Replit Ready**: All configurations optimized for Replit environment including CORS and host settings

## Architecture
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express server with Socket.IO for real-time collaboration
