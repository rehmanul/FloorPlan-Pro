- **Server Running**: Node.js/Express server with WebSocket support running on 0.0.0.0:5000
- **Frontend Verified**: Single-page application with glassmorphism UI working correctly
- **Deployment Configured**: Set up autoscale deployment for production using `npm start`
- **Workflow Active**: Development server running with nodemon for hot reloading

## Architecture
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express server with Socket.IO for real-time collaboration
- **Frontend**: Single-page HTML application with modern CSS and JavaScript
- **CAD Processing**: Autodesk Platform Services (APS) integration for file processing
