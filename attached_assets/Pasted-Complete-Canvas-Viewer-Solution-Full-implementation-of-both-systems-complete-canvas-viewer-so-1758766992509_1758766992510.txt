‚ö° IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION
Step 1: Add Canvas Controller to Your HTML
xml
<!-- Add this canvas element to your index.html -->
<canvas id="floorPlanCanvas" width="800" height="600"></canvas>

<!-- Include the complete solution -->
<script src="complete-canvas-viewer-solution.js"></script>
Step 2: Initialize in Your JavaScript
javascript
// Initialize the unified controller
window.floorPlanController = new UnifiedFloorPlanController({
    canvasId: 'floorPlanCanvas',
    enableDualMode: true, // Enable both canvas and viewer
    autoSync: true
});

// Initialize canvas
await window.floorPlanController.initializeCanvas({
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
    showGrid: true,
    enablePanning: true,
    enableZooming: true
});

// Initialize viewer overlay (when viewer is ready)
if (window.viewer) {
    await window.floorPlanController.initializeViewer(window.viewer);
}
Step 3: Update Your generateIlots Function
javascript
async function generateIlots() {
    // ... your existing API call code ...
    
    const result = await response.json();
    const ilots = result.ilots || [];
    
    // Add to both canvas and viewer using unified controller
    if (window.floorPlanController) {
        await window.floorPlanController.addIlots(ilots);
        console.log('‚úÖ √élots added to both canvas and viewer');
    }
    
    // ... rest of your code ...
}
üéØ EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER IMPLEMENTATION:
Manual Canvas View:
‚úÖ Interactive Drawing - Pan, zoom, draw walls/√Ælots

‚úÖ Real √élot Placement - Generated √Ælots appear instantly

‚úÖ Tool System - Switch between view/draw/edit modes

‚úÖ Grid System - Professional CAD-like interface

Autodesk Viewer Overlay:
‚úÖ 3D √élot Visualization - Colored boxes with labels

‚úÖ 3D Corridor Paths - Extruded corridor geometry

‚úÖ Interactive Selection - Click √Ælots to see details

‚úÖ Synchronized Views - Canvas and viewer stay in sync

Combined System:
‚úÖ Dual Mode Operation - Both views work simultaneously

‚úÖ Mode Switching - Toggle between canvas/viewer focus

‚úÖ Auto-Sync - Changes in one view appear in other

‚úÖ Professional CAD Experience - Full-featured floor plan system

üõ°Ô∏è WHY THIS SOLVES YOUR PROBLEMS:
Canvas Problem ‚Üí SOLVED:
Before: No canvas implementation, buttons do nothing

After: Full interactive canvas with pan/zoom/draw/edit capabilities

Viewer Problem ‚Üí SOLVED:
Before: √élots can't appear on Autodesk model

After: 3D √Ælots and corridors overlay directly on the floor plan model

Integration Problem ‚Üí SOLVED:
Before: Two separate, non-communicating systems

After: Unified controller synchronizes both views automatically

Implement the complete solution from and both your canvas and viewer will be fully functional with √Ælot/corridor placement! üöÄ
